## Overview
This repository provides R scripts for machine learning analyses to predict the risk of bipolar relapse 
in **first-episode bipolar disorder (FEBD)**.  

The analyses include:
- Development and validation of ML models
- Comparison across algorithms
- Fairness analyses
- Time-to-event methods
- Pharmacoepidemiological meta-analyses
